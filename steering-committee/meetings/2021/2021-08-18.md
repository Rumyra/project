## Notes

* Mike Smith (W3C) did a really interesting update of the Progressive Web Apps overview page today ([info](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/8023#issuecomment-901001432)). Kudos! He was able to significantly improve it without falling into the rabbit hole.
* Thank you to Samsung team and esp. Lola for organizing us around the write the docs event in October.

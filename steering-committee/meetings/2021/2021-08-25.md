## Agenda / Notes

1. (Florian) WebXR docs
    - Wrote reference pages for Hit Testing Module & dynamic viewport scaling
    - Now all WebXR APIs that Chromium browsers ship are documented
    - Remaining modules: Layers, Hand Input, Frame rates (Oculus ships these)
    - Backlog: [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/35](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/35#issuecomment-884700236) 
2. (Florian) Mixins
    - Moving WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope to a _globals folder in BCD, see [https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/11518](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/11518) 
    - MDN pages to live at the top-level under API? E.g. Web/API/fetch
3. (Florian) August worklog post
    - Will start to write this and plan to publish at the end of next week. Please share your August achievements with me and I’ll include it!
4. (Jean-Yves) HTTP/2
    - The [branch on git](https://github.com/teoli2003/content/tree/h2/files/en-us/web/http/http2) where I store my (crude) drafts.
    - Started the draft of the _[Overview](https://github.com/teoli2003/content/blob/h2/files/en-us/web/http/http2/overview/index.md)_ and _[HTTP/2 Prioritization](https://github.com/teoli2003/content/blob/h2/files/en-us/web/http/http2/prioritization/index.md)._
    - In this later article I _briefly _describe the different algorithms implemented in IE/Edge (&lt;79), Safari, Firefox, Chromiums (including Edge ≥ 79).
    - Do you have (e-mail) contact info to internal people that can review these algorithms? It will be about 10 lines per engine and I would like to check the accuracy of my text as my sources are 3-4 year old.
      - Dominic Cooney: For Chromium I would contact net-dev@chromium.org, https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/net-dev
    - Next step: Draft of _HTTP/2 Connection Model_ and _HPACK._
    - Once I have the 4 drafts I can start sharing for early feedback.
5. (Jean-Yves) Mentioned last week, Peter is [migrating](https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/4081) structured data files (like `GroupData.json` and `InterfaceData.json.` Ryan has taken this over.  \
I wrote the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/JSON_Structured_Data) for these. We are waiting for the migration to be finished.
6. (Will) Markdown conversion for Web/API
    - This is the biggest piece of MDN, ~6500 pages
    - Working through it in this issue: [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/7898](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/7898) 
    - Thanks Jean-Yves for all the reviews!

## Notes
- Dom: combining webref and github actions to generate InterfaceData.json 
- Jory: WtD update: have asked the WtD team if we can sponsor them. Thanks Lola for getting it going. Hopefully in a couple of weeks it will be through.

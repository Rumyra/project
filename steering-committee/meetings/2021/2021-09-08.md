2. (Florian) After this call: First content/project planning call for Q4
    - Please submit proposals!
    - Agenda: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMf3zGUrGgtjhAxoppkgH6IhsBB0bD6QSqgYmDkyg7s/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMf3zGUrGgtjhAxoppkgH6IhsBB0bD6QSqgYmDkyg7s/edit#) 
3. (Florian) WebXR reference docs
    - Working on the missing API pages: Layers, Hand Input, Frame rates. Backlog: [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/35](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/35#issuecomment-884700236) 
4. (Estelle) ARIA roles
    - Working on converting all ARIA roles to markdown, writing the missing ARIA roles and finishing those that were started, creating an ARIA roles landing page, and adding more links between related resources.
5. (Estelle) OWD Branding
    - Update on logo and branding progress (communication has been initiated, but people are on vacation)
6. (Will)
    - Markdown: Web/API docs are almost ready be converted ([https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/7898](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/7898)) - the only remaining issue is to confirm we’re happy with the decisions around tables
    - Markdown: I’ve filed the issue to convert: [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/8741](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/8741) in which a plan is outlined. If you want to help review and are not in the list, let me know!
    - Spent a day looking at using webref as a source for CSS formal syntax: [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/44](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/44) . It looks very doable.
        - webref only includes syntax for properties, not selectors or at-rules
        - I think we should also start using css-tree: it makes the code much simpler and more reliable, and we can do more with it
7. (Ruth) Welcome Daniel who will be a Mozilla representative moving forward
8. (Jean-Yves)
    - Working on HTTP (a bit slower than expected)
    - Worked on lowering amount of MDN flaws (we are below 10000), as this can be done in smaller pieces

## Notes

* Estelle: 
    * Branding: thanks to JetBrains for offering to help. People are on vacation now but will pick it up when they get back. Estelle will also invite people in this call to be involved.
    * formal syntax: ask for a volunteer to write an interactive widget for exploring formal syntax? As a standalone thing we could embed in MDN pages?
* Jean-Yves: automatic flaw fixing is not supported in Markdown.

## Agenda

1. Florian and Jean-Yves are out of office this week.
2. (Will) JS Learn area:
    - I have finished my PR to update the “[Introducing JavaScript objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)” module: [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/11373](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/11373). The core articles have had review by Ruth and Hamish, thanks! Remaining articles need review still, and I need to update the supporting [learning-area](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/oojs) content.
    - After that I need to update the “[Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)” and “[Client-side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs)” modules, then we are done with this project. Hopefully they will be quicker and simpler than the Objects one!
3. (Estelle) 
    - Reviewed a lot of PRs
    - Edits to a11y, and aria-required
4. (Will) Content planning meeting is next Wednesday! This week is a great time to think about projects we should work on next. Either new proposals, or projects in our backlog:[ https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues) to see what stands out.
5. (AOB)

## Notes

(Will) checking with Florian to see if we should postpone of go on with planning meeting next week

(All) Discussion on how to remove redirects to once a page is re-redirected.

(Estelle) Will open issue on yari to add re-redirecting: when file b is redirected to file c, but there is a redirect from a to b, get yari to edit the a-to-b to be a-to-c.
